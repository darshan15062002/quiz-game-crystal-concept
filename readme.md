Excited to share my latest project â€“ a cool quiz feature! ðŸš€ As a student, I wanted to make studying more fun, so I built a system where admins (like me!) can create quizzes super easily. What's even cooler? The quiz automatically stops 24 hours after it's scheduled. ðŸ•’

I used the awesome combo of React.js for the front end, Node.js, and Express for the back end, and MongoDB for storing all the quiz magic. ðŸ“šâœ¨ But here's the techy part â€“ I hooked it all up with RESTful APIs and JWT authentication for security ninja vibes. ðŸ”’
